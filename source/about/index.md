# About me
Hi internet, my name is Ricardo 'Rik' Illescas, AKA 'riktothepast'. I'm a software engineer from Guatemala City, Guatemala.

I like to make games, you can play some of my work in the Games section.

Also I do some 'volunteer' work on the Guatemalan Game Developers Community, GameDevGT. And in the Unity User Group UnityGT follow the links to see more info about it.
